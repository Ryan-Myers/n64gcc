# N64 GCC

This is just a repository to test a method for automated builds of a customized GCC specifically targeting N64.
It's a cut down version of a more completed script found here: https://github.com/aglab2/winn64libs/blob/main/build-gcc.sh

I removed all options, and went with the defaults as a method for simplifying the build script, and hopefully making a standard verson that will work for N64 decomp projects.
